        <h2>Lesson overview</h2>
        <p>
          In this lesson you will compare two widely used approaches to scheduling technology
          projects: the traditional waterfall model and agile development. Both approaches use time
          as the organizing dimension, but they make very different assumptions about how stable the
          requirements are and how often the team should release working software. As a technology
          manager you do not need to treat one as universally better than the other. Instead, your
          job is to understand the strengths and limitations of each approach so that you can choose
          or blend them in a way that fits the context of your project.
        </p>
        <p>
          We start by revisiting the idea of a phase based schedule, where large blocks of work such
          as requirements, design, implementation, and testing occur in sequence. This is the
          waterfall pattern, which matches what many organizations use for hardware and regulated
          systems. We then contrast that with agile scheduling, where work is sliced into many short
          cycles called sprints. Each sprint delivers a small increment of value and invites feedback
          before the team plans the next increment. From a scheduling perspective, this changes the
          shape of the timeline and where risk shows up.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of the lesson you should be able to explain how a waterfall Gantt chart usually
          looks compared to an agile release roadmap, and how those visuals reflect deeper
          management philosophies. You will also reflect on scenarios where a waterfall style plan
          is still appropriate and scenarios where agile cadence is a better fit. This understanding
          will support more informed scheduling choices in your own coursework and future projects.

        <h2>Waterfall scheduling</h2>
        <p>
          In a waterfall schedule, the project is divided into a small number of large phases that
          follow one another in a straight line. Typical phases include requirements, system
          design, implementation, verification, and deployment or maintenance. Each phase has its
          own start and end dates, and the team is expected to complete most of the work in one
          phase before moving on to the next. On a Gantt chart this looks like long, contiguous bars
          that stretch across the timeline with little overlap. This style of scheduling supports
          tight control, detailed documentation, and clear contractual checkpoints.
        </p>

      <section class="lesson-section">
        <h2>Agile scheduling</h2>
        <p>
          Agile scheduling takes a very different view. Instead of one long pass through the phases,
          work is broken into repeated sprint cycles, often two to four weeks long. Each sprint
          includes planning, building, and reviewing a subset of features that come from a prioritized
          product backlog. On the calendar, this appears as a sequence of short iterations, each with
          its own goals and retrospective. The overall product roadmap still matters, but the detailed
          plan for later sprints is intentionally left flexible so the team can adapt to learning and
          changing conditions.
        </p>

        <h2>Choosing between the two approaches</h2>
        <p>
          The choice between waterfall and agile scheduling should be driven by the nature of the
          work. When requirements are well understood, regulatory constraints are tight, or
          coordination with external suppliers demands long lead times, a waterfall style schedule
          can reduce ambiguity. When requirements are uncertain, user feedback is critical, or the
          team needs to test assumptions quickly, agile scheduling is usually more effective. Many
          organizations blend the two, using a waterfall style roadmap at the portfolio level while
          allowing teams to work in agile sprints within their slice of the plan.
