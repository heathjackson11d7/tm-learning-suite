        <h2>Lesson overview</h2>
        <p>
          In this lesson you will learn how Gantt charts translate a list of activities into a clear,
          time based picture of a project. Gantt charts are one of the oldest and still most widely
          used tools in project management. They are valuable because they compress several pieces
          of information into a single visual: what work needs to be done, when it is planned to
          happen, how long it is expected to take, and how different activities overlap. Technology
          managers rely on Gantt charts to align stakeholders, coordinate cross functional teams,
          and track progress against promised delivery dates.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will start with the basic structure of a Gantt chart and the elements that appear in
          almost every example. You will see how tasks are listed down the left side and time is
          represented along the horizontal axis. From there we will look at how durations, start and
          finish dates, and dependencies are represented, and how milestones can be used to mark key
          decision points. Throughout the lesson, the focus is on interpreting the chart as a
          communication tool rather than on memorizing symbols.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of this lesson you should be able to read a simple Gantt chart and explain what
          it is telling you about the project schedule. You will also be able to identify common
          pitfalls, such as schedules that show everything starting at once or charts that hide
          critical bottlenecks. This will prepare you for later lessons where we compare different
          scheduling approaches and discuss how overlapping work can change cycle time. For now, the
          goal is to become comfortable using Gantt charts to tell a clear story about how work is
          organized over time.

        <h2>The core structure of a Gantt chart</h2>
        <p>
          At its simplest, a Gantt chart is a table combined with a horizontal bar chart. Each row
          represents a task or activity, and each column on the horizontal axis represents a unit of
          time such as a day, a week, or a sprint. The bar in each row shows when that task is
          planned to start and finish. Longer bars represent longer tasks, and the relative position
          of the bars shows which tasks come earlier or later in the project. This structure makes
          it easy for a technology manager to scan the chart and understand the overall flow of
          work.

        <h2>Durations, dependencies, and milestones</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond simple timing, Gantt charts can represent relationships between tasks. If one task
          cannot start until another has finished, a small arrow or a note can show that
          dependency. This matters because delays in one task can ripple through the schedule and
          affect many others. Milestones are special markers that indicate major events such as
          design sign off, beta release, or launch. On the chart they often appear as diamonds or
          flags aligned with particular dates. Milestones help teams see whether they are on track
          for the most visible commitments in the project.

        <h2>Using Gantt charts for communication</h2>
        <p>
          A key strength of Gantt charts is that they provide a common reference point for people
          who view the project from different angles. Executives may focus on high level milestones
          and overall duration, while engineers may care more about the ordering of technical tasks
          and integration windows. When a chart is kept up to date, it becomes a shared map that
          supports planning meetings, risk reviews, and status reports. The chart will never be a
          perfect prediction of reality, but it is an effective way to show the current plan and the
          implications of proposed changes.
