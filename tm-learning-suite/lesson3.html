        <h2>Lesson overview</h2>
        <p>
          In this final lesson you will examine how the structure of work across stages influences
          the total time it takes to complete a project. Many organizations are accustomed to fully
          sequential development, where concept work must be finished before product design begins,
          and design must be finished before process design or testing can start. This pattern feels
          safe, but it often leads to long cycle times and limits the ability of teams to learn in
          parallel. To respond to faster markets, firms in technology intensive industries have
          increasingly turned to partly parallel or concurrent development models.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will look at visual examples of both patterns and interpret what they mean for calendar
          time, risk, and coordination effort. You will see how overlapping stages can create earlier
          feedback loops between engineering, manufacturing, and marketing, which allows problems to
          be discovered before they become expensive. At the same time, starting work before upstream
          decisions are fully locked introduces the possibility of rework if those decisions later
          change. As a technology manager, you are constantly balancing the desire for speed with the
          cost and risk of making changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of this lesson you should be able to explain why many firms have adopted partly
          parallel processes and under what conditions this strategy can backfire. You will also
          connect these ideas to the Gantt charts and agile schedules from earlier lessons, seeing
          how different scheduling choices can either hide or reveal where stages genuinely overlap.
          The goal is not to memorize one correct pattern, but to understand the tradeoffs so you
          can participate in design discussions about how your own projects should be structured.

        <h2>Fully sequential development</h2>
        <p>
          In a fully sequential schedule, each stage has a clearly defined start and finish, and
          downstream teams wait until upstream work is complete before they begin their own tasks.
          This offers simplicity. Interfaces between stages can be documented thoroughly, and
          managers can make go or kill decisions at stage boundaries. However, if serious issues are
          discovered in a late stage such as testing or launch preparation, the project may have to
          loop back to earlier stages, adding large amounts of unplanned time. The more rigid the
          sequence, the more vulnerable the project becomes to this type of late discovery.

        <h2>Partly parallel and concurrent processes</h2>
        <p>
          In a partly parallel schedule, later stages are allowed to start before earlier stages are
          completely finished. For example, manufacturing engineers might begin designing tooling
          while the product design team is still finalizing details. Marketing may begin planning
          launch campaigns while testing is underway. This overlap means that questions and concerns
          can surface earlier, giving teams a chance to adjust while there is still time. The
          overall cycle time from project start to launch can be significantly reduced, especially in
          long and complex development programs.
        </p>

      <section class="lesson-section">
        <h2>Managing the tradeoffs</h2>
        <p>
          Overlapping stages is not free. It increases the need for communication, version control,
          and shared understanding of which design aspects are frozen and which are still open to
          change. If coordination is weak, teams may invest effort in work that becomes obsolete,
          negating the time savings. Successful concurrent development therefore depends on clear
          milestones, disciplined documentation, and a culture that encourages early escalation of
          risks. When these conditions are in place, partly parallel schedules can provide a powerful
          advantage in industries where time to market is critical.
